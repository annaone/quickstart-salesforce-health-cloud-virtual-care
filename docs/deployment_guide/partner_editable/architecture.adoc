image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture-diagram-salesforce-health-cloud-virtual-care.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* Amazon Chime media control plane for receiving requests from Salesforce Health Cloud when patients request appointments through their healthcare provider application.
* An EventBridge rule that filters aws.chime events and a predefined https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-transform-target-input.html[input transformer rule^] that modifies the event and creates a https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm[{partner-company-short-name} platform event^].
* During an active session via a {partner-company-short-name}-connected app, Amazon Chime SDK to communicate to the Amazon Chime media services endpoint to receive transcription requests.

* Amazon Transcribe Medical for receiving and processing transcription requests.
* For event delivery failure handling:
** An Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue that serves as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rule-dlq.html[dead-letter queue^].
** AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt all messages stored in the Amazon SQS queue.
** An Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors the Amazon SQS queue depth and alerts when the configured threshold is exceeded.
** An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send email notifications to interested parties when the CloudWatch alarm is triggered.

* An AWS Secrets Manager secret for securely storing {partner-company-short-name} credentials and connection secrets.
















* An Amazon EventBridge rule that filters `aws.chime` events and a predefined https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-transform-target-input.html[input transformer^] to create a https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm[{partner-company-short-name} platform event^].
* An Amazon Chime media services endpoint for receiving transcription requests from the {partner-company-short-name}-connected app sent via the Amazon Chime SDK, which then passes the requests to Amazon Transcribe Medical for processing.
* An Amazon EventBridge API destination with a predefined connection and secret using {partner-company-short-name}-connected app details to submit events to the default Amazon EventBridge bus.
* An Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue acting as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rule-dlq.html[dead-letter queue^] for failed event delivery.
** AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) to encrypt all messages stored in the Amazon SQS queue.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors the Amazon SQS queue depth and alerts when the configured threshold is exceeded.
* An Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic to send email notifications to interested parties when the CloudWatch alarm is triggered.
* An AWS Secrets Manager secret for securely storing {partner-product-short-name} credentials and connection secrets.
