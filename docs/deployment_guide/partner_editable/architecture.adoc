image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/architecture_diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Quick Start sets up the following:

* An Amazon EventBridge rule that filters `aws.chime` events and a pre-defined https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-transform-target-input.html[input transformer] to create a https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.platform_events.meta/platform_events/platform_events_intro.htm[{partner-company-short-name} platform event].
* An Amazon Chime Media Services endpoint for receiving transcription requests from the {partner-company-short-name} connected app sent via the Chime SDK, which then passes the requests to Amazon Transcribe Medical for processing.
* An Amazon EventBridge API destination with a pre-defined connection and secret using {partner-company-short-name} connected app details to submit events to the default Amazon EventBridge bus.
* An Amazon SQS queue acting as a https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/eb-rule-dlq.html[dead-letter queue] for failed event delivery.
** AWS KMS is used to encrypt all messages stored in the SQS queue.
* An Amazon CloudWatch alarm that monitors the Amazon SQS queue depth and alerts when the configured threshold is exceeded.
* An Amazon SNS topic to send email notifications to interested parties when the CloudWatch alarm is triggered.
* An AWS Secrets Manager secret for securely storing {partner-product-short-name} credentials and connection secrets.
